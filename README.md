# LudumDare 39

## Presentation

I started this project during the Ludum Dare 39, but I didn't look the official theme.

I created a little city-builder in javascript to train me to developp in this language. And I continue to work this project in order to improve it and to have fun.

## Resources
I realized this code alone (with a few help from my friends).

For graphics, I found my resources on the web :
